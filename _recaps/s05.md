The party attended the Ember Festival opening ceremony and bonfire in the Arajin Market. In addition to witnessing some of these festivities and partaking in a good deal of looted brandy, the group wandered through the festival grounds, briefly visiting some vendors including Ma Zarah the fortune teller, before having a conversation with Kostis Jei, the Market Keeper. After recognizing the party’s actions in defending the Hibbleorn caravan and the cemetery, and hearing the party’s plan to move on to Stillhaven, Jei referred the group to a friend of his, the merchant Prieten in that city.

The party spent the next day training and the following gathering equipment before they set out on the road again. They met up with Farbin and travelled to Stillhaven.
