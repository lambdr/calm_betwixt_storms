The party set out from Stillhaven to the ruins of Renwick, following the foothills of the Wyrmbone Mountains. The group observed a pair of hippogriffs attacking other travellers ahead, but decided to skirt the feeding beasts, and set up a secluded camp in the wilds.

The following day, the Embers pushed on, fighting a hobgoblin patrol, arriving in the ruins somewhat south of their targeted location. They travelled to the temple complex that Ryazan had described but fell into a goblin ambush. After defeating the goblins, the group explored the outbuildings, recovering some food, coin, and notes in goblin about an item called an Ioun Stone. Now the party pushes into the main temple complex.
