As the party caught their breath in the cemetery following their fight with the necromancer, they had a heart to heart and discussed some of their reasons for adventuring.

The next day, they set out to the market, selling some of their acquired loot and seek out information. They were unable to get information about the sword that they’d taken from Mizal the brigand, but learned that a nearby sage named Lazos may be able to offer assistance. Alternatively, they looked towards Stillhaven, the first town across the Gilvry border, 

As the group explored the market, they met a new adventurer, the gnome bard Saskarill.
Now they head to the bonfire as the festival begins.
