The party progressed into the temple complex in the ruins of Renwick, in search of the silver ewer. They first encountered more hobgoblins and a bugbear, slain in a moment of (foolish?) bravery by Contessa. Their further explorations yielded an as-yet unexplored staircase and a chamber with faded depictions of the Dawn War. 

The Embers also rushed into another chamber, taking the occupants – a hobgoblin warrior and goblin druid – by surprise. A pitched battle ensued, in which Jadwiga fell unconscious, but the party prevailed through martial and magical force. With their foes slain, Ellywick cared for Jadwiga, and the rest of the party recovered the ewer, a vase, and gloves, among other loot.

The following morning, Jadwiga returned to consciousness and discussed her concerns with Ellywick, while Regill and Contessa examined a magical basin with a cryptic command carved into it. After some discussion, with ewer in hand, the party now moves to finish their search of the complex.
