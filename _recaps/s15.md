The party’s foray to the Iubit Cathedral continued, with the group reuniting after all had had time for prayer. They then swung by Lord Ryazan’s manor to collect a letter from him to a member of the College of the Naga. Then, armed with pachi juice, they collected Iacob and Matias, and set off for Inlarut. 

As they journeyed, the days passed quickly – except for Regill whose hunger pangs grow stronger each day. Since setting out, Saskarill sought satisfaction to her suspicions of the strange circumstances surrounding Iacob & son’s sorrowful sojourn. The time it took to reach The Golden Hawk was slightly longer than expected, with the party taking most of a day to forage for additional supplies, but ultimately they reached the waypoint. 

They restocked a bit, exchanged a bit of information with the sisters who owned the inn and fellow travellers, and enjoyed a comfortable night, before setting out onto the road again.
