The Embers of the Vale arrived at Prieten’s house and enjoyed brunch with the stone merchant. After exchanging pleasantries about Kostis Jei, they asked a number of questions about the town, learning that Lord Haylich Ryazan does reside in the northern quarter. They also inquired a bit about the recent murder of the butcher Ahlun Nest, and decided that the renown they gained through solving the murder might be leveraged into meetings with Lord Ryazan and/or the Lord Arcanist.

The party began their investigation of the murder, interviewing a tailor and jeweller who witnessed a skull-faced beast and small humanoid leaving the scene – headed to Zinman’s Furs. They also snuck into the butcher’s shop, first identifying the corpse of the dead butcher, with Jadwiga returning to talk to the butcher’s apprentice. She learned that Nest had stayed late to deal with a client – from Zinman’s Furs.

Saskarill meanwhile went to Zinman’s Furs, finding out that a halfling worker had not shown up for work and was dealing with some “personal problems”.
