The Embers arrived at Lord Ryazan’s manor, speaking with his inconspicuously armed elven gardener Dragos. After being led into the house, the Contessa commenced a magical search, revealing a number of magical auras, including those on the person of Dragos and Lord Ryazan. 

Haylich Ryazan himself appeared surprised to meet the party, but otherwise nonplussed. He explained that he acquires valuable artifacts and magical items for interested parties, and that he was interested in a bone fragment from the Hero of Arajin Vale – a job that the party had seemingly stopped. Lord Ryazan offered the party another job, to retrieve a silver ewer from the Ruins of Renwick, somewhat to the west of the town. 

The party agreed to retrieve the ewer, and after learning of the goblin patrols that apparently skirt the ruins, they took some time to prepare, before heading into danger and adventure.
