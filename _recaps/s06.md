The party arrived in Stillhaven, bidding Farbin and his caravan farewell for the time being. Their attention was first captured by construction on the wall, which they learned was due to repairs inflicted during Mehrti’s siege of the town. The party spoke briefly to the architect overseeing the wall’s repairs, learning that the project was somewhat delayed, before they explored the town.

The group visited the Nitza Bazaar, sampling some of the local wares and taking note of a statue of Lady Eresh featured prominently in the square. They then retired to rooms at the Dour Rat, and after some deliberation, decided to name their group “The Embers of the Vale”.

The following morning, the recently christened Embers set forth from their Inn to their brunch rendezvous. As they passed through the town square to Prieten’s house, they noticed a gathering of guards and civilians, and a brief investigation revealed a word of murder. Deciding that “it’s not our business, they’ll still be dead [after brunch]”, the party continued on their merry way, arriving at Prieten’s.
