The party tracked the krenshar to the town’s wooded park, preparing to hide while baiting it with both meat and the clothes of its owner Zalner. While the bait succeeded in drawing out the creature, the plan that involved Saskerill magically incapacitating it failed, although Regill quickly dispatched it before any harm could come to the party.

Thus victorious, the Embers marched to Singur Keep, where they received an evening audience with Baroness van Gane and some of her court. They succeeded in earning an audience with Mystif Carn, the Lord Arcanist, a letter of introduction to Lord Ryazan, and quarters for the evening. Although Contessa, Jadwiga, and Saskerill engaged in some snooping each, their primary discovery was the displeasure of the Captain of the Guard.

The following morning, the party broke their fast in their quarters and then met with the Lord Arcanist. He was able to identify both the amulet recovered from the necromancer and the recovered sword, naming it as Surzhit a millennia-old weapon forged in the early days of the Ilharic Empire. He also suggested that there might be more information about the blade to be found in specific tomes of lore.
