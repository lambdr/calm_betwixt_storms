When last we met, you had taken a job guarding a caravan of merchants travelled to the Gilvry Principalities by way of the Arajin Vale. The recent peace had restored many of the trade routes between these warring nations. You had joined onto one eager caravan, preparing to cross the border into Gilvry, but first visiting a local market for its summer’s end celebration, the Ember Festival.

While on your way to the Arajin Market, you were ambushed by group of brigands, who triggered a rockslide to bifurcate the caravan. The four of you successfully repelled the assault, although additional brigands absconded with some valuable merchandise.

After a moment to catch your breath, the party pursued the fleeing bandits into the woods. Although you briefly lost the trail of your quarry, you ultimately tracked them to their cave hideout, aided by Ellywick and a local chipmunk. You lured out the two guards at the mouth of the cave and dispatched them, but not before one was able to raise the alarum. You have a few moments to collect yourselves and prepare to face the rest of these brigands.
