The Embers of the Vale celebrated Pyre Day in Stillhaven, while preparing for their travel to Inlarut. Contessa, Jadwiga, and Saskarill searched for information about the politics of Inlarut and the College of the Naga, learning about some discord in the High Prince’s Council. As part of these inquiries, Jadwiga visited the merchant Prieten and received a letter to take to his son Baiat, along with some information about the city. Meanwhile, Regill stocked up on alchemical supplies and ammunition, and Ellywick tended to the graves in the cemetery.

The next morning the party set out to conclude their business in town, receiving a letter from Lord Ryazan to visit him, after he’d mentioned being able to help introduce Matias to the College of the Naga. First, however, the party visited Iubit Cathedral, where Ellywick and Contessa had an audience with Gorvin, the only cleric of Lord Nin in the town. Ellywick voiced some of her doubts about serving Nin, and difficulty ascertaining the path forward. While Gorvin answered some her questions about his life and work, he ultimately said that the only being that could answer what Nin’s intent for Ellywick is is the god himself. Ellywick prayed to Nin for guidance, and seemingly received a vision in response. What the vision portends, however, is yet to be seen.
