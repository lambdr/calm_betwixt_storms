The Embers of the Vale continued their investigation into the death of the butcher Ahlun Nest. They visited the bookstore Fablebound and talked with the owner Taenaran about the receipt found at the murder scene. The party convinced Taenaran to reveal that the book was sold to Zalner Tallstep, and where Zalner resides. After the group shared some information about the beast sighting, Taenaran suggested that it might be a predator known as a krenshar. 

The group followed Taenaran’s lead to Zalner’s house, but were unable to pick the lock, and decided not to break in, opting instead to ask around, ultimately receiving a tip to go to The Twisting Vine, a tavern near the town’s edge. At the tavern, the group attempted to bribe the bartender (eventually succeeding), learning that Zalner frequented the tavern and was awaited by another patron.  

Jadwiga confronted the other patron, a man named Nazz, learning that Zalner had a bit of a gambling problem and owed a fair bit of money to unnamed lenders. Jadwiga and Nazz exchanged some info, with Jadwiga receiving the location of one of Zalner’s friends. The party found and confronted Zalner, learning that he had won the krenshar as a cub while gambling with a strange woman. The party searched Zalner’s house and now prepare to hunt the krenshar.
